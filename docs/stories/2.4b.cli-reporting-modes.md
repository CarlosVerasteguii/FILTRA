# Story 2.4b: CLI Reporting Modes

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** CLI user,
**I want** quiet and wide modes that align with the reporting specification,
**so that** I can control verbosity and layout without losing the final entities summary.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a `--wide` flag surfaced in CLI help and warm-up output that toggles additional columns in the report renderer.
2. Quiet mode suppresses progress logs but still prints the final entities section unless an error occurs.
3. CLI help and documentation describe quiet and wide behavior with PowerShell-friendly examples.
4. Automated tests validate quiet output, wide column rendering, and help text updates.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Extend CLI options for report rendering (AC: 1,2) [Source: architecture/components.md#cli-command-layer][Source: architecture/components.md#report-composition-layer]
  - [ ] Introduce a boolean `--wide` option on the `run` subcommand that passes through to reporting. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Ensure quiet mode still renders the final entities section while suppressing progress logs. (AC: 2)
- [ ] Update reporting entry points (AC: 1,2) [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#entity-processing-flow][Source: architecture/components.md#report-composition-layer]
  - [ ] Accept quiet/wide parameters in the reporting composer/renderer so layout logic is centralized. (AC: 1,2)
  - [ ] Adjust rendering to add the sources column only when wide mode is enabled, keeping default width near 100 columns. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Refresh documentation (AC: 3) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals-cli-ux.md#core-screens-and-views-terminal-sections]
  - [ ] Update CLI help text and docs to describe quiet and wide behavior with Windows-oriented examples. (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Note that the warm-up command echoes whether wide mode is active when previewing report capabilities. (AC: 3)
- [ ] Expand automated coverage (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#quiet-and-wide-modes]
  - [ ] Add CLI integration tests ensuring quiet output still includes the entities section and that wide runs render the sources column. (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add unit tests around formatting helpers for quiet/wide toggles if logic lives outside CLI integration tests. (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Coordinate with Story 2.4a so the reporting layer receives canonical entities, contexts, and source metadata. [Source: docs/stories/2.4a.entities-canonical-model.md]
- Work closely with the reporting story (2.4) to verify layout expectations and localized labels once rendering is implemented. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.entities-report-section.md]

## Testing
- Integration coverage should live under tests/integration/ or tests/cli/ and assert quiet vs wide behavior using deterministic fixtures. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Unit tests should verify helper routines that compute row layouts for default and wide modes. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#quiet-and-wide-modes]
