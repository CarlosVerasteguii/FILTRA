# Story 1.1: CLI Project Scaffold

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a pinned, Windows 11-friendly CLI scaffold,
**so that** I can run and iterate reliably without native build tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `requirements.txt` with pinned versions exists; `python -m venv .venv && pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds on Windows 11 without native compilers.
2. A CLI entry point `filtra.py` (or package `filtra/__main__.py`) accepts `--resume` and `--jd` and prints usage with `-h/--help`.
3. Logging set to INFO by default, `--quiet` reduces to WARN+; no secrets printed.
4. README includes PowerShell-friendly examples with quoted paths.
5. Document initial repository bootstrap instructions (git init, first commit, README scaffolding) so newcomers can reproduce setup.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No previous story insights; this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
- CLI must be Typer-based with `run` and `warm-up` subcommands, delegating to orchestrator and diagnostics modules. [Source: architecture/components.md#cli-command-layer]
- CLI warm-up invokes diagnostics service that prefetches models and checks OpenRouter connectivity; keep hooks ready for future implementation. [Source: architecture/components.md#diagnostics-warmup-service]

### File Locations
- Core CLI package resides in `filtra/` with entry modules (`cli.py`, `__main__.py`) and orchestrator-related packages as outlined in the source tree. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Repository root includes tooling files (`requirements.in`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, `README.md`) and sample assets under `samples/`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests should live under `tests/test_cli.py` mirroring the package structure and use pytest with pytest-mock for CLI behaviour. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Plan integration/golden sample CLI tests (`tests/integration/test_cli_run.py`) once pipeline logic lands; scaffold placeholders only if needed. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]

### Technical Constraints
- Runtime targets Python 3.10.11 with Typer 0.12.3, pip-tools 7.4.1, and other library versions defined in the tech stack; lock dependencies accordingly. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Enforce Black (line length 100) and Ruff linting, and keep CLI PowerShell-friendly to honour Windows-first standards. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]
- Configure logging via `rich.logging.RichHandler`, default INFO output, and quiet mode downgrade to WARN. [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]
- Document local install workflow (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and align README guidance with Windows demo deployments. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#deployment-strategy]
- Scaffold should reflect monolithic CLI pipeline flow so later modules can plug into parser, NER, scoring, and reporting stages. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#high-level-overview]

### Testing
- Follow pytest-based workflow with coverage targets (=85% overall) and include error-path assertions for CLI argument validation in future implementations. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Prepare to mock external HTTP interactions via httpx.MockTransport or pytest-httpx when wiring CLI to OpenRouter in later stories. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
CLI scaffold is tidy and the Typer wiring behaves as expected; pytest suite (4 tests) passes and logging quiet mode suppresses info output. Primary risk is dependency determinism: `requirements.txt` only lists top-level pins, so installs can drift and the "generated by pip-compile" comment is misleading.

### Refactoring Performed
None.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: V (Typer CLI, logging, and README examples align with architecture guidance)
- Project Structure: V (Files match the scaffold layout and onboarding docs cover the Windows-first flow)
- Testing Strategy: V (tests/test_cli.py exercises help, quiet, and validation paths under pytest config)
- All ACs Met: ? (AC1 needs fully pinned transitive dependencies in requirements.txt)

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Regenerate `requirements.txt` with `pip-compile` so transitive dependencies are pinned and AC1 stays deterministic (requirements.txt)
- [ ] Replace the stray `??` callout in the README tip with the intended icon/text for clarity (README.md)

### Security Review
No sensitive data is logged; quiet mode effectively limits output to WARN+.

### Performance Considerations
CLI commands are lightweight placeholders; no performance risks identified at this stage.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Gate Status

### Review Date: 2025-09-26 (Re-review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Fully pinned `requirements.txt` now includes transitive deps, but introducing `click==8.3.0` breaks Typer 0.12.3 compatibility. The CLI crashes when rendering help (`Parameter.make_metavar()` missing `ctx`) and the pytest suite fails at import time because `CliRunner` no longer accepts `mix_stderr`. AC2/3 regress and the scaffold cannot be executed.

### Refactoring Performed
None.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: V (structure and logging still follow the standards)
- Project Structure: V (files remain in the expected locations)
- Testing Strategy: X (pytest aborts before running tests due to click/Typer incompatibility)
- All ACs Met: X (AC2/3 fail because the CLI cannot run)

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Pin click to a Typer-compatible version (e.g. 8.1.7) or upgrade Typer to restore CLI/help functionality and fix test runner (`requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Update CLI tests after dependency decision so `CliRunner` initialisation matches the supported signature (`tests/test_cli.py`)
- [ ] Replace the stray `??` callout in the README tip with accessible wording/icon (README.md)

### Security Review
No new logging of sensitive data observed, but CLI crash prevents validating runtime safeguards end-to-end.

### Performance Considerations
Unavailable - CLI fails before executing commands; performance not evaluated.

### Files Modified During Review

### Review Date: 2025-09-26 (Final QA)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Re-pin to `click==8.1.7` restores Typer compatibility; CLI help/commands execute cleanly and the pytest suite (4 tests) passes. README callout now uses readable ASCII and dependency lock shows full transitive pins for deterministic installs.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: requirements.in
  - **Change**: Added an explicit `click==8.1.7` constraint before compiling the lockfile.
  - **Why**: Typer 0.12.3 requires click 8.1.x; newer 8.3.0 introduced breaking changes for help formatting.
  - **How**: Keeps dependency graph stable on Windows while still allowing pip-compile automation.
- **File**: requirements.txt
  - **Change**: Regenerated via `pip-compile requirements.in`, producing a fully pinned lock with click 8.1.7.
  - **Why**: Aligns AC1 with reproducible installs; removes the incompatible click 8.3.0 pin.
  - **How**: Ensures downstream installs use the compatible versions Typer expects.
- **File**: README.md
  - **Change**: Replaced the Unicode icon with a `Note:` callout in the execution policy tip.
  - **Why**: Avoids placeholder rendering issues and meets the ASCII-first guideline.
  - **How**: Keeps onboarding instructions accessible in all terminals.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: V (CLI structure, logging, and docs align with architecture guidance.)
- Project Structure: V (Dependencies and README remain in specified locations.)
- Testing Strategy: V (`pytest` succeeds; CLI exercised manually with quiet and default runs.)
- All ACs Met: V (AC1 deterministic installs, AC2/3 CLI usability, AC4/5 README onboarding confirmed.)

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Pin click to a Typer-compatible version and regenerate the lockfile (requirements.in, requirements.txt)
- [x] Validate CLI help/quiet behaviour after dependency update (`python -m filtra ...`)
- [x] Replace the execution policy placeholder with accessible wording (README.md)

### Security Review
Logging still omits sensitive contents; dependency adjustments do not introduce new exposure.

### Performance Considerations
Baseline commands remain lightweight; no regressions observed during manual CLI runs.

### Files Modified During Review
- requirements.in
- requirements.txt
- README.md

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS - docs/qa/gates/1.1-cli-project-scaffold.yml
Risk profile: Not generated (scope limited to CLI scaffold review)
