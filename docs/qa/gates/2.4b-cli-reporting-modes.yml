acceptance_criteria_validation:
  ac1_wide_flag:
    status: PASS
    notes: '--wide flag surfaced in CLI help (filtra run --help), warm-up output mentions report modifiers, renderer toggles sources column correctly'
  ac2_quiet_mode:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Quiet mode suppresses progress logs (logging.WARNING level) while preserving final entities section output to stdout'
  ac3_documentation:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'CLI help updated, README.md includes PowerShell examples for --quiet and --wide, warm-up diagnostics describe modes'
  ac4_automated_tests:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Tests validate quiet suppression, wide column rendering, help text updates; assertions are resilient (content-based, not width-based)'

implementation_quality:
  code_structure:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation: CLI defines options, orchestrator passes flags, renderer respects options'
  standards_compliance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Follows coding standards: black formatting, proper module structure, CLI output discipline maintained'
  test_coverage:
    status: PASS
    notes: '25 CLI tests pass, specific tests for quiet mode, wide mode, and help text; avoids brittle assertions'

nfr_validation:
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Code is clear and maintainable; ReportRenderOptions provides clean abstraction for future render flags'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling preserved in quiet mode; renderer handles empty states gracefully'
  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Helpful tip in default mode guides users to --wide; quiet mode reduces noise as expected'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Table rendering is efficient; no performance concerns with wide mode'

final_notes: |
  This is a textbook implementation of CLI reporting modes. The developer:
  
  1. Properly wired flags through all layers (CLI → orchestrator → renderer)
  2. Maintained ASCII-only output with stable ~100 column default width
  3. Added comprehensive tests that validate behavior without brittle assertions
  4. Updated all relevant documentation (help text, README, warm-up output)
  
  The code quality is excellent, test coverage is comprehensive, and all acceptance 
  criteria are fully satisfied. No issues or concerns identified.
  
  Story is ready for Done status.
