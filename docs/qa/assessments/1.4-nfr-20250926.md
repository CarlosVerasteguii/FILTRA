# NFR Assessment: 1.4

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Input validation avoids sensitive path leaks; no secrets logged.
- Performance: PASS - Decode attempts limited; minimal I/O work.
- Reliability: PASS - Deterministic fallback and newline normalization; failure paths tested.
- Maintainability: PASS - Utilities isolate behavior; tests document expectations.

## Critical Issues

None.

## Quick Wins

- Consider a short README note highlighting cp1252 fallback for Windows users.
