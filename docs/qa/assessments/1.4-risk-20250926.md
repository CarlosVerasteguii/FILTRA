## Detailed Risk Register

| ID       | Category  | Title                               | Prob | Impact | Score | Priority |

### TECH-001: Locale/encoding mismatch on Windows

- Description: Users with ANSI-saved JDs must still succeed; verify fallback behavior.
- Mitigation: Implemented UTF-8 BOM first, cp1252 fallback; tests validate behavior.
- Testing Requirements: Unit tests for decode/normalize, integration test for CLI summary.
- Residual Risk: Minimal.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

- Validate fallback and newline normalization first (unit), then integration CLI behaviors.
