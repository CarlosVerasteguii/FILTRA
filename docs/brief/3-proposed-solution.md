# 3. Proposed Solution

FILTRA is a command-line tool built in Python that integrates two types of AI: a Large Language Model (via OpenRouter) for qualitative analysis and compatibility scoring, and a locally-run HuggingFace NER model for structured data extraction (skills, companies). It processes a resume and a job description to generate a concise report, empowering recruiters to make faster, data-driven decisions.
