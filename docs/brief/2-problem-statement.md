# 2. Problem Statement

Recruitment teams, like the one at RRHH Ingenia, spend a disproportionate amount of time manually screening resumes. This process is slow, prone to human error, can introduce unconscious bias, and delays the identification of the most promising candidates. Existing solutions are often costly or lack the flexibility to analyze technical compatibility with expert-level depth.
